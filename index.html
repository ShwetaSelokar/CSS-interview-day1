    <p>1.Difference between flex row and column.</p>
    <div>
        This is a css property based on the concept of the flexbox.
        Flex direction property applied to the parent elements and then the child elements of this parent tag will be placed accordingly.
        The difference is when we apply flex direction row, child elements will be placed one after another in the same row(horizantally) then the row or the x-axis will be considered as the main axis, in this case the y-axis will be known as cross-axis.
    </div>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
        If we apply flex direction column places the child elements in columns(vertically) means every child element will be placed one after another in the same column, and then y axis will be considered as the main axis and x axis will be considered as cross axis.
    </div>
    <p>Ex:</p>
    <div class="container-column">
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
        <div class="flex-items"></div>
    </div> 
    
    <p>2.Explain inline, internal and external stylesheet</p>
    <div>
        Inline styling: 
        It applied directly to the element in the style attribute. This styling is having the highest priority among all. But it is not advised to use this styling much in projects.
        Ex: style="color: red";
    </div>
    <div>
        Internal styling:
        It is written in the head tag of the html file. It will be written in the style tag. The styling written in style tag will be applicable only in that html file.
    </div>
    <div>
        External styling:
        It is done by creating a different CSS file with .css extension. This file can be linked to any HTML file wherever the styling is required. The external CSS file can be attached to the HTML file in the head tag in the link tag. This styling is having the least priority but it is the most advised way of writing styling in projets.
